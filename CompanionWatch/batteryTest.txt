1st Test: 10 minutes, battery from 90% -> 89%
2nd Test: 1 hour, battery from 87% -> 81%

Overall, linear battery usage, 1% every 10 minutes.
Hoping that by reducing the write frequency from every second to every 2 seconds,
I can halve the battery usage by the app. 

3rd Test - Light sensor writing every 2 seconds, still used 6%

4th Test - 2 sensors (Light and Accelerometer) writing every second for an hour: 92% -> 83%
Overall usage 9% :( going to see if I can optimize it.

5th Test - 2 sensors (Light and Accelerometer) writing every 3 seconds for an hour: 44% - 35%
Overall usage 9%

6th Test - 2 sensors, no write to database, polling every second: 61% -> 53%
Overall usage 8%

7th Test - No CPU Lock, screen off, 2 sensors, polling every 3 seconds: 95% -> 87%

8th Test - 2 sensors, write to DB, polling every 30 seconds for 10 minutes: 63% - 62%

9th Test - 2 sensors, write to DB, polling every 15 seconds for 10 minutes: 60% - 59%

10th Test - 2 sensors, write to DB, polling every 15 seconds for 60 minutes: 57% - 50%

11th Test - 2 sensors, write to DB, polling every 30 seconds for 60 minutes: No difference

12th Test - 2 sensors, write to DB, using changeListner: 96% -> 91%! Hooray!
